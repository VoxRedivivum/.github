VoxRedivivum is a project intent on delivering high quality voice cloning based TTS capabilties to those who have lost the use of their voice. Based around the coqui-ai TTS API, a Flask backend and a Flutter-based app deployed to multiple platforms, the VoxRedivivum project is a personal project run by a single person. All repositiories will likely remain private for some time. If you have questions about the project or want access for your own needs, please contact @fultonms.
